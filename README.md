# Custom GridWorld for patient rehabilitation



## Training of the agent 
- option 1 run src/agent/train_agent.py cells like with #%%
- option 2 'python src/agent/train_agent.py' ( no args for the moment)

## Manual playing of the game
Plays in the terminal (no GUI)
- Cells Runs #%% inside file src/visualization/manual_play.py
- 'python src/visualization/manual_play.py'


## TODO
- Increase difficulty by increasing the distance target-agent 
- Implement an Inference to see how the trained NN plays
- Freeze some neurons to see the change in behaviours
